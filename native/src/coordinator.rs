//! Coordinator-owned application state and commands.
//!
//! One thread owns `Config`, the log tailers, the activity engine, the
//! `Recorder`, the library index, and the in-flight recording draft. The GTK
//! thread holds a `CoordinatorHandle`: one bounded command sender, one
//! capacity-one snapshot receiver, and one capacity-one stopped receiver. A
//! second thread runs the serial `MediaWorker`; the coordinator owns its join
//! handle and dispatches at most one job at a time so automatic finalization
//! always precedes queued user transcodes.
//!
//! Notes:
//! - Advanced-combat-logging status is read from `<log dir>/../WTF/Config.wtf`
//!   when the tailers are (re)opened; it refreshes on arm/save.
//! - Test recordings synthesize the minimum parsed events for the chosen
//!   category. `ForceEnd` stops a running test.
