# Changelog

Notable changes to the native Linux/Wayland application. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Release history before the native rewrite belongs to the upstream Electron
project, [aza547/wow-recorder](https://github.com/aza547/wow-recorder).

## Unreleased

### Added
- Warcraft Recorder Pro cloud upload, compatible with the Windows app's
  guild cloud: a Cloud settings page for the account, password and guild,
  **Upload to cloud** and **Copy share link** in the recording menu, an
  **Upload** bulk action, optional automatic upload of new recordings, and
  upload progress on the status card. Share links are copied to the
  clipboard when you requested the upload. Large files go up in 100 MiB
  parts on their own thread, so an upload never delays saving the next pull.
- The Flatpak gains network access (`--share=network`) for the uploads.

## 1.0.10 - 2026-09-09

### Added
- The combat meter gains a Buffs tab with per-player buff uptime, and the
  buff list shows buff icons instead of a folded "Other" row.

### Changed
- Startup and bulk library edits are faster. Orphan detection and sidecar
  loading no longer build throwaway JSON trees, the scan orders entries
  without cloning them, and tagging or protecting many recordings lets the
  coordinator service the recorder and combat log between writes. On a
  498 MiB library the pre-library-snapshot work drops from 2.2 s to 1.1 s at
  half the peak memory, and protecting 37 recordings from 2.1 s to 0.79 s.

### Removed
- The AppImage migration path and the one-time Electron config import with its
  post-migration notice are gone. Every user is on the Flatpak now.
- The one-time startup backfill that rewrote old Electron sidecars with
  Bloodlust timelines parsed from historical combat logs is gone. Sidecars
  that were already enriched keep their timeline.
- A recording made by the old Electron application whose category is not one
  this application knows is now skipped instead of being listed under an
  "Unknown" category. Recordings in the normal categories are unaffected.
- Old Electron recordings no longer report a video codec in the library. Every
  other detail they carry is unchanged.
- Dead code left behind by earlier removals: the imported-path constructor
  orphaned by the Electron config import, an unused spell-database size
  accessor, a write-only first-time-setup flag, a duplicate spell-data fetch
  script, and a development-only meter replay example.

## 1.0.9 - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- A seek issued while Clapper is still prerolling is deferred until the item
  is ready, instead of dropping it and wedging every later seek for that
  video.
- Scrubbing back past the first cast of a selected meter spell no longer
  panics the process.
- A second launcher invocation claims the single-instance lock before any
  storage work, so it no longer moves the first instance's active recording
  into Recovery.

### Changed
- Finishing a recording, deleting, and evicting now update the library index
  in place instead of rescanning the whole library, which blocked the
  coordinator and allocated heavily on large libraries.
- A hidden combat meter no longer rebuilds its widgets on every tick, and the
  occurrence and death histories are virtualized, keeping large meters cheap.

## 1.0.8 - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- Captures that begin and end in the same moment no longer desynchronize the
  gpu-screen-recorder recording toggle, which had silently stopped every later
  capture from producing a file.
- A capture that produces no video file now replaces the recorder child, so
  the next recording still saves instead of going silent.

## 1.0.7 - 2026-08-21

### Added
- A local combat meter is available alongside each recording, with damage
  done, damage taken, healing, interrupts, dispels, casts and deaths. It
  supports current-fight and overall views, player spell and target
  breakdowns, and seeking from meter rows into the video.
- Previous and next controls jump between the visible combat-timeline markers.

### Changed
- Player controls now focus on video and combat review; the drawing overlay
  has been removed.

### Fixed
- Combat logs with the newer UTC-offset timestamp suffix are parsed instead of
  silently rejecting every event.

## 1.0.6 - 2026-08-13

### Added
- Midnight patch 12.1 raid encounters and Mythic+ dungeons are now recognized
  and recorded.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- Resolved screen-capture crashes no longer leave stale problem indicators
  after automatic restart, rearming, or capture-target reselection.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Combat-log timestamps now use the system timezone and daylight-saving
  changes instead of UTC.
- A stale saved-recording event can no longer be attached to a newer
  recording.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-08-08

### Fixed
- Restarting the media worker no longer deadlocks when the worker is busy:
  the shutdown request now waits to be delivered instead of being dropped.
- Folder validation no longer overwrites an existing probe file: the write
  probe uses an exclusive unique name and reports write failures.

### Changed
- `install.sh` is the documented one-command install: on a machine without an
  AppImage it only adds the remote, installs the app, and starts it, and a
  re-run updates an existing install instead of failing. Missing Flatpak now
  prints the command that installs it, and the installer warns when the
  session cannot record: X11, no screen-capture portal, or no PipeWire, each
  with the fix spelled out.
- README rewritten for players: one install command, the three things the
  system needs, first-run steps, and measured footprint against the Electron
  build.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-07-28

### Added
- A "What's new" dialog on the first start after an update, listing the
  commits between the previous release and the installed version. Closing it
  records the version, so it appears once per update.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- The post-migration notice stayed pending after being dismissed, so it
  reappeared on every start: a settings save carried the draft the notice
  itself had opened Settings on, writing the pending flag back.
- "Advanced combat logging is off" was reported for every sandboxed install.
  The check reads `Config.wtf` beside the Logs folder, which the folder portal
  does not export, so an unreadable file now reads as unknown rather than off.
- The AppImage migration left the old app running and its binary on disk.

### Added
- The recording folder and combat-log folder rows pulse until they are
  selected, including after a migration, where the imported paths need picking
  again before the sandbox can reach them.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-27

### Added
- Native Rust/GTK4 application: combat-log watching, activity detection,
  `gpu-screen-recorder` capture, JSON sidecar library, playback with a combat
  timeline, clipping, drawing overlay, and local POV switching.
- Live keystone timers from the API when computing a Mythic+ result, with
  hardcoded timers as a fallback.
- A one-time notice on the first launch after a legacy import: what changed,
  what carried over, and the two folders the sandbox needs selected again.

### Changed
- Flatpak is the only install and update path. Recordings and configuration
  stay local; legacy configuration is imported once and left untouched.
- Cloud, account, upload, and localization features are not part of this fork.
- `install.sh` migrates an AppImage install instead of replacing it: it
  installs the Flatpak, preserves the AppImage for rollback, retires the
  AppImage launchers, and starts the native app.
