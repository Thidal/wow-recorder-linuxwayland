# Warcraft Recorder

Warcraft Recorder records your World of Warcraft gameplay by itself. It watches
the combat log and saves a video for every raid pull, Mythic+ dungeon, arena,
solo shuffle and battleground, with a death timeline you can jump through,
clipping, slow motion, a local-POV switch and a detailed local combat meter.

Linux and Wayland only. Everything stays on your machine unless you turn on
Warcraft Recorder Pro upload.

## Combat review without leaving the recorder

The built-in meter shows damage done and taken, healing, interrupts, dispels,
casts and deaths alongside the video. Switch between the current fight and
overall data, filter by target, drill into each player's spells and jump to
the relevant moment in the recording.

For many reviews this can replace finding or uploading a report on Warcraft
Logs: the detailed combat data is already available inside the recorder and
stays on your machine.

## Install

One command in a terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohanWes/wow-recorder-linuxwayland/main/install.sh | bash
```

If your terminal says `curl` is missing, use the Flatpak commands below instead.

It installs the app from the project's signed Flatpak remote and starts it.
Run the same command again any time to update.

Prefer typing the commands yourself?

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists warcraft-recorder \
  https://johanwes.github.io/wow-recorder-linuxwayland/index.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user warcraft-recorder io.github.JohanWes.WarcraftRecorder
```

## What you need

- **A Wayland desktop session.** KDE Plasma, GNOME, Hyprland and COSMIC all
  work. X11 does not.
- **Flatpak.** Most gaming distributions ship it. If it is missing, the
  installer shows the command for common distributions (`sudo pacman -S
  flatpak`, `sudo dnf install flatpak`, `sudo apt install flatpak` or `sudo
  zypper install flatpak`).
- **Desktop screen sharing**, meaning `xdg-desktop-portal` and PipeWire. This
  is how a sandboxed app is allowed to see your screen, and every mainstream
  desktop already sets it up. A hand-assembled Hyprland or wlroots session may
  still need its own portal package.
- **A GPU with hardware video encoding**, which most AMD, Intel and NVIDIA
  cards from the last decade have.

If your session is missing Wayland, the portal or PipeWire, the installer says
so.

The recorder (`gpu-screen-recorder`), the video player and FFmpeg are all
inside the Flatpak, so there is nothing else to install and nothing to keep in
sync. Flatpak also downloads the shared GNOME runtime if you do not already
have it: that is a set of libraries, not the GNOME desktop.

## First run

1. In Settings, pick your **recording folder** and your **World of Warcraft
   Logs folder** (for example
   `.../World of Warcraft/_retail_/Logs`). The app highlights both until they
   are set.
2. In WoW, turn on **Advanced Combat Logging** (Escape → Options → System →
   Network), and use an addon such as
   [SimpleCombatLogger](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simplecombatlogger)
   so logging starts on its own when you enter an instance.
3. Play. Each activity shows up in the library when it ends. Closing the window
   keeps recording from the tray icon, so long as your desktop has a tray:
   GNOME needs the
   [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)
   for one, and without it, closing the window quits the app.

## Sharing through Warcraft Recorder Pro

If your guild has a [Warcraft Recorder Pro](https://warcraftrecorder.com)
subscription, this fork can upload to it just like the Windows app:

1. In Settings → Cloud, turn on **Upload to Warcraft Recorder Pro** and enter
   the cloud account name, password and guild name you use in the Windows app.
   The account needs write access to the guild.
2. Right-click a recording and choose **Upload to cloud**, or select several
   and use **Upload** in the selection bar. The status card shows progress;
   when an upload finishes, its share link is copied to your clipboard.
3. **Copy share link** on a recording that is already uploaded fetches its
   link again.
4. Turn on **Upload new recordings automatically** to upload every new
   recording once it is saved. Automatic uploads never touch your clipboard.

The password is kept in the app's config file, readable only by you. Nothing is
sent anywhere unless cloud upload is turned on.

## Update and uninstall

Updates arrive through your software centre, or:

```sh
flatpak update --user io.github.JohanWes.WarcraftRecorder
```

To remove the app while keeping your videos and settings:

```sh
flatpak uninstall --user io.github.JohanWes.WarcraftRecorder
```

Your recordings are ordinary files in your recording folder and are never
touched by an uninstall.

## Why the rewrite

This version is written in Rust with GTK4 instead of Electron. Measured on the
same machine, with the app open and idle on an empty library:

| | This version | Old Electron version |
|---|---|---|
| Install | ~43 MB | 187 MB |
| Memory (idle) | ~150 MB | ~650 MB |
| Application processes | 1 | 7 |
| CPU (idle) | ~0% | ~0% |

The whole application is a single 29 MB binary built on eleven direct
dependencies, with no browser engine, no database and no background services.
Recording itself costs almost nothing either way: `gpu-screen-recorder` encodes
on the GPU, exactly as it did before.

## Development

One Cargo package under `native/`. From the repository root:

```sh
cargo fmt --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --all-targets
cargo build --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --release
```

[`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md) for candidate and signing steps.

## Scope and license

This fork is Linux/Wayland-only and English-only. Of the upstream cloud
features, only Warcraft Recorder Pro upload and share links are ported;
browsing, downloading and deleting cloud videos stay on the website. Licensed GPL-3.0-or-later. Capture is
[`gpu-screen-recorder`](https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/); the
original [Warcraft Recorder](https://github.com/aza547/wow-recorder) is prior
art.
